# MediaPlayer

Sometimes in app development we have to create an example app to test the functionality of the main app. This is one of those example. This is a very basic Media Player App that will play the music, pause it and after the music file is finished playing a Toast message will appear to tell the user that the music is finished. I would not supply the mp3 file due to copyright issues therefore if you want to use this code make sure you use your own mp3 file and store it in a raw directory (create it) in the res folder.
